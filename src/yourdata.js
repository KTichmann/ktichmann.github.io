  // About Secton --------------
  aboutParaOne: "I'm a fullstack web developer building scalable websites, apps, and APIs. At work, I work mostly with PHP (CakePHP) and Vue for website development, and Flutter for mobile development.",
  
  aboutParaTwo: "As a self-taught developer I'm always looking to improve my knowledge and skills through taking online courses and learning new technologies. My interest in programming began when I came across CS50x,Harvardâ€™s Introduction to Computer Science on edX. This course gave me an intriguing overview of computer science and, after completing it, I moved on to other courses, learning as much as I could about programming in my free time.",

  aboutParaThree: "In my current position, I work on building scalable, dynamic websites that see thousands of visits a day. I've recently begun working on Flutter (mobile app) projects at work, building both the app functionality, and the backend API that the app connects to.",
